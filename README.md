# VHPredictor

This is the implement of "VHPredictor: Protein Language Model-Based Virus Representations Insights into Virus-Host Interactions". 

Powered by a `protein language model`, VHPredictor rapidly and accurately predicts `interactions between viruses and hosts` using only the `virus proteins` as input.

## Requirements
<span id="requirements"></span>

Follow the steps in [requirements.sh](requirements.sh)

## Data preparation
<span id="data-preparation"></span>

We have released our experiment data, which can be downloaded from [Zenodo](TODO).

## Reproduce all our experiments with only one file
<span id="main"></span>

- Reproduce all our experiments with good visualization by following the steps in [main.ipynb](main.ipynb)

**Notice: Detailed results are saved in** `vhpredictor_data/experiment/test_result/figure`.

## Run VHPredictor locally
<span id="pipeline"></span>

- Run VHPredictor locally by following the example in [pipeline.ipynb](pipeline.ipynb)

**Notice: the inputs and outputs of the example are saved in** `example/`.
